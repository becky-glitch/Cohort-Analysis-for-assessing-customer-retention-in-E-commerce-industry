# Cohort-Analysis-for-assessing-customer-retention-in-E-commerce-industry
### Overview
In this project, I delved into Cohort Analysis to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior. This analytical approach enabled me to segment customers into cohorts based on their purchase behavior over time, which was instrumental in identifying key retention opportunities and optimizing marketing efforts. By analyzing these cohorts, I developed strategies that helped businesses improve customer engagement and increase the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns

### Business Problem
E-Shop Pro is facing a significant challenge in retaining its customers. While the company has been successful in acquiring new customers through marketing efforts and promotions, it has noticed a concerning trend of declining customer retention rates. This is a critical issue in the highly competitive e-commerce industry, where customer loyalty and repeat business are paramount.While E-Shop Pro collects vast amounts of customer data, it has not effectively leveraged this data to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. This underutilization of data is a missed opportunity for improving customer retention.
### Aim of the Project
This project aims to gain comprehensive insights into user engagement patterns and content preferences on the Streamlix platform. 
By conducting a rigorous cohort analysis, Streamlix seeks to understand the evolving behavior of distinct user groups over specific timeframes. This endeavor is driven by the imperative to refine content curation, optimize user experience, and ultimately, maximize user satisfaction.
